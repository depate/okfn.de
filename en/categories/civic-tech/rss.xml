      <description>This git repository contains all German federal laws and regulations in markdown format. The XML version of these laws available on gesetze-im-internet.de serves as the source. With BundesGit the most current version of the laws is saved. Hereby, their historic development and adaptation is transparent and easily comprehensible.</description>

      <description>Code For Germany is a network of groups of volunteer volunteers (Labs) who use their skills to positively shape their cities and social life. They advocate more transparency, open data and participation in their cities. In particular, they mediate between civil society, administration and politics and use their skills to improve communication between them and to provide the necessary impetus so that as many people as possible can benefit from the possibilities of open and free digitisation.</description>

      <description>The central task of a parliament is to draw up and debate a budget. This essential political process decides which activities the state can carry out and which services cannot be provided. Budget data must be published by law. Unfortunately, the format is not standardised, which means that booklets with more than 1000 pages are printed and slowly deteriorate in the town hall or placed as PDF files on the corresponding websites.</description>

      <description>With the Prototype Fund we support socially relevant software projects and increase their sustainable impact through open source as a matter of principle. In short: We support Public Interest Tech. We make digital-social innovation possible; with developer groups that bring a wide range of skills to bear in technology design and pass on their good ideas. With up to 47,500 euros per project and team, the funding fund supports software developers, hackers and creative people in implementing sketches for tools and applications in the areas of Civic Tech, data literacy, IT security and software infrastructure.</description>

      <description>https.jetzt! is a project to show how many government websites support HTTPS. Why is website encryption important? Any unencrypted transmission of data can be intercepted on the Internet and thus manipulated. Therefore, it is obvious that any transmission of sensitive data, such as orders in online shops, online banking or logins to websites with non-public content, should only be encrypted. For the user this means: If in doubt, for example when using online order forms, you should always check in the address bar whether an encrypted transmission is displayed there.</description>

      <description>The right to ask questions is an important right of MEPs - and a frequently used parliamentary control instrument. In the Bundestag alone, thousands of small questions are asked in each parliamentary term, which must be answered in writing by the government. If you add the questions asked in the parliaments of the LÃ¤nder, a huge pool of useful information results which is scattered throughout the various online archives. On kleineanfragen.</description>
