      <description>DatenmachenSchule shows the potential of using open data in the classroom. The initial idea for the project came from a study published in 2013 on the subject of Open Data by the Fraunhofer Focus Institute:
&amp;ldquo;Open administrative data [&amp;hellip;] in principle holds the chance of a new educational design (Open Educational Resources)&amp;ldquo;.
In order to pursue this thesis, a cooperation between the administration of the city of Moers, the Gymnasium Adolfinum, the Rhein-Waal University of Applied Sciences and the Open Knowledge Lab Niederrhein was formed.</description>

      <description>The Data School is a nationwide educational program on the subject of data and technologies. We are aimed at non-profit organizations that work with data or want to deepen their existing knowledge. Within a cooperation period of about three months, we developed practice-oriented workshops and individualized technical training courses with our partners and trainers to support social projects. We want non-profit organizations:
 to encourage targeted use of data and technology in their work.</description>

      <description>How can we empower children and young people today to become the shapers of tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s society? What makes young people more visible as actors? What role do digital means play here? And how can participation succeed on the digital and social levels?
In order to answer these and other questions, we have developed various workshop formats and materials with the democracy laboratories in order to help a broad target group of children and young people to experience self-efficacy in the field of democracy and technology.</description>

      <description>The shaping of family life in Germany has changed enormously in recent decades. Patchwork families, multi-generation houses and households of single parents bring completely different requirements with them. One of the biggest challenges is the compatibility of family and career. Or to put it another way: Is it really necessary to have to sit in a doctor&amp;rsquo;s waiting room for three hours each time? We think: this works better.

      <description>Jugend hackt is a program designed to support young coders.
While such competitions as ‘Jugend musiziert’ (Music) and ‘Jugend forscht’ (Science) have been established in Germany for decades, there are few intiatives directed towards young talent in the field of software development. To fill this gap, Open Knowledge Foundation Deutschland e.V., together with a media education agency, Mediale Pfade, organized the first Jugend hackt event in 2013. Since then, it has become a successful and well-established hackathon for young coders from all over Germany.</description>

      <description>The Turing Bus is a mobile educational project for schools and youth clubs in rural areas. The bus brings representatives of Fablabs, OK-Labs and Hackspaces as well as experts in digital topics to often underserved places of youth education in order to generate an exchange of knowledge through workshops, discussion formats, screenings and more. The project is funded in the Science Year of the BMBF.
The bus wants to explore, discuss and critically question the role of digitisation and technology for profession and society with workshops, lectures and hands-on sessions.</description>

      <description>edulabs sees itself as a supra-regional incubator in which people use their didactic, technical and creative skills to develop innovative and re-usable educational materials. The project works on three levels: Concept development, provision and advertising of free educational materials as well as community building and support. Throughout Germany edulabs organizes meetings of interdisciplinary teams where free educational materials (OER) and digitally supported methods are evaluated, created, documented and improved. The lab community is supported editorially, didactically, technically, as well as with the organization of Events.</description>
