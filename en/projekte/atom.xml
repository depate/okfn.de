With the FragDenStaat online platform, we support citizens in exercising their right to access information from German authorities. Citizens no longer have to work their way through the legal jungle of the federal states and the federal government to make a request.</summary>

While such competitions as ‘Jugend musiziert’ (Music) and ‘Jugend forscht’ (Science) have been established in Germany for decades, there are few intiatives directed towards young talent in the field of software development. To fill this gap, Open Knowledge Foundation Deutschland e.V., together with a media education agency, Mediale Pfade e.V., organized the first Jugend hackt event in 2013. Since then, it has become a successful and well-established hackathon for young coders from all over Germany.</summary>
