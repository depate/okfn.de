They disclose information on tax payments, licenses, production volumes and other important data relating to the extraction of oil, gas and mineral resources. Especially the populations of countries rich in raw materials can benefit from this. Where information about revenues is disclosed, there is less distrust, fewer conflicts and less money can flow into the economic and social development of a country. Through publicly accessible information, EITI also promotes a factual debate on resource policy and the use of natural resources.

Together with partner institutions in Germany, Greece and the Netherlands, the refugee phrasebook team develops sustainable communication tools to share phrases, icons and helpful links. All materials are adaptable for local needs and distributed with open licenses to foster communication between refugees, citizens and helpers all over Europe. Our goal is to empower refugees all across Europe to communicate and voice their needs, independently of network access and battery life, even if they can only stay in a country for a limited time. With adaptable designs and collections of important phrases, helpful links and essential information, we aim to connect and support initiatives with refugee groups, to foster a sustainable culture of welcome combined with the values of an open society. We supported the refugeephrasebook.de volunteer team with coordination and a donation …"

Examples for such applications include www.fixmystreet.com and www.everyblock.com. We supported developer teams with financial support in the form of stipends and invited them to a camp with workshops in Berlin."

But for a long time there was a lack of generally accessible sources. It was not until the turn of the millennium that many German states took a big step: freedom of information was the order of the day. Through freedom of information laws, the first state parliaments in Berlin and Brandenburg obliged local administrations and state authorities to renounce the previously valid official secrecy. The aim was to give citizens access to public data upon request - regardless of whether they were directly affected by this data. This includes contracts, notes, written correspondence, video and audio recordings as well as expert opinions. Because knowledge is power. For the first time, we have compared freedom of information and transparency laws at federal and state level."

The project is funded in the Science Year of the BMBF.

Within the framework of a referendum, we will implement the draft law for the whole of Berlin by 2021. The Transparency Act obliges the Senate and the authorities to disclose important information to the public. This includes Senate resolutions, secret contracts with companies, expert opinions, e.g. on water quality or the development of land prices, as well as data on public contracts.

Any unencrypted transmission of data can be intercepted on the Internet and thus manipulated. Therefore, it is obvious that any transmission of sensitive data, such as orders in online shops, online banking or logins to websites with non-public content, should only be encrypted. For the user this means: If in doubt, for example when using online order forms, you should always check in the address bar whether an encrypted transmission is displayed there. Serious and professional providers will not request data from the customer via unencrypted channels. But encryption also makes sense for the transmission of normal web content. Encryption ensures that the user only receives the data he has requested. Not only can unencrypted data be manipulated, but malware can also be inserted into the data in public WLANs, for example. And last but not least, encryption generally makes it …"
